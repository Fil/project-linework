Project Linework
================
Working website for Project Linework. Find the current files at [somethingaboutmaps.com](http://somethingaboutmaps.wordpress.com/project-linework/)

> Project Linework is a library of handcrafted vector linework for cartography, each one designed in a unique aesthetic style. Itâ€™s meant to break us away from the default line paths that we so often rely on by providing some more visually-interesting alternatives.

Mr. Huffman has written up a post about his inspiration and vision for Project Linework. [Read](http://somethingaboutmaps.wordpress.com/2012/07/19/linework-like-typefaces/) about it.

##TODO

* ~~Design~~ [View mockup](http://svmatthews.github.io/project-linework/)
* Build download & info UI for homepage
* Extent UI for each file's data extent on the globe (visual or written?)
* Data ( ~~shp~~ | ~~geojson~~ | **topojson** | ~~ai~~ ) - Topojson still needs some work since conversions didn't work properly. [Issue #1](https://github.com/svmatthews/project-linework/issues/1)
* Test
* ~~Convert to Jekyll~~ on Github pages ( need to create `gh-pages` branch or set up new repo for project-linework.github.io )
* Update _config.yml to reflect GHs instead of local server `baseurl: null`
* Share
