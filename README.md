Project Linework
================
This is the page for the Project Linework geo-files. The website can be found on the [gh-pages branch](https://github.com/svmatthews/project-linework/tree/gh-pages) of this repository. Find the current files at [somethingaboutmaps.com](http://somethingaboutmaps.wordpress.com/project-linework/)

> Project Linework is a library of handcrafted vector linework for cartography, each one designed in a unique aesthetic style. Itâ€™s meant to break us away from the default line paths that we so often rely on by providing some more visually-interesting alternatives.

Mr. Huffman has written up a post about his inspiration and vision for Project Linework. [Read](http://somethingaboutmaps.wordpress.com/2012/07/19/linework-like-typefaces/) about it.
