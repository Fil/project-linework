(very) Working website for Project Linework. Find the current files at [somethingaboutmaps.com](http://somethingaboutmaps.wordpress.com/project-linework/)

#TODO

* ~~Design~~ [View mockup](http://mapsam.com/project-linework)
* Data conversions (~~shp~~ > ~~geojson~~ > topojson AND ~~ai~~) - Topojson still needs some work since conversions didn't work properly
* Test
* Convert to Jekyll on Github pages
* Share beatiful linework with the world

Style files all include:

* Illustrator CS3 File
* Admin0 & Admin1 Shapefiles
* Admin0 & Admin1 GeoJSON
* Admin0 & Admin1 Topojson
* Readme

Extras:

* Source map if from a historical print map
* Extra land types (i.e. streams, lakes, waterbodies)
* Secondary Admin types (i.e. lines instead of polygons)

Probably going to be under the MIT license but that depends on Daniel Huffman
