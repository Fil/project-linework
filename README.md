Project Linework
================

Project Linework is a library of handcrafted vector linework for cartography, each one designed in a unique aesthetic style. Itâ€™s meant to break us away from the default line paths that we so often rely on by providing some more visually-interesting alternatives. Download the current files at [projectlinework.org](http://projectlinework.org/). [Learn more](http://projectlinework.org/about/) about Mr. Huffman's inspiration.

Linework is controlled in the `master` branch. [projectlinework.org](http://projectlinework.org/) is controlled in the `gh-pages` branch.
