		<h1>How projectlinework.org runs</h1>
		<p>Project Linework's new homes comes with a few updates but aims to keep things simple. All of your linework sets currently include downloads in four file types: <strong>Shapefile, Geojson, Topojson, and Adobe Illustrator</strong>. These have been hand-crafted for your use in any way you please.</p>

<p>The download packages are hosted by the <a href="http://giscollective.org">GISCollective</a> and the website is running completely on <a href="https://github.com/svmatthews/project-linework/tree/gh-pages">Github pages</a> with jekyll. The most up-to-date linework sets can also be <a href="https://github.com/svmatthews/project-linework">found on Github</a>, but we urge you to download from the links on the website for fully-functioning data sets.</p>
