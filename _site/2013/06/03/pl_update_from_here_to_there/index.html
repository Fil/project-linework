		<p>The linework files below (but not necessarily the example maps) are public domain; use them as you see fit. Please consider giving credit to the author where possible. And please, feel free to drop me a line showing off the maps you’ve made using these. I and the other contributors would like to see these things in action!</p>

<p>Each linework set is distributed as an Esri Shapefile and as an Adobe Illustrator document (complete with projection/scale/coordinates of one point specified in the AI file, so you can reference and reproject it in MAPublisher).</p>

<li>List item</li>
<li>another one</li>
<li>maybe we'll do three</li>
