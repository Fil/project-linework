Project Linework
================

Project Linework is a library of handcrafted vector linework for cartography, each one designed in a unique aesthetic style. Itâ€™s meant to break us away from the default line paths that we so often rely on by providing some more visually-interesting alternatives. Download the current files at [projectlinework.org](http://projectlinework.org/). [Learn more](http://projectlinework.org/about/) about Mr. Huffman's inspiration.

Linework is controlled in the `master` branch. [projectlinework.org](http://projectlinework.org/) is controlled in the `gh-pages` branch.

## Conversions

You can convert all shapefiles of a particular linework set by using `convert.sh <linework_set_name>`. In order to convert/update a linework set this way we assume:

1. you have a `/shp` file directory set up in your new linework set with properly formatted Shapefiles
1. you have installed `gdal` on your computer to use `ogr2ogr` to convert shapefiles to GeoJSON
1. you have installed `topojson` globally on your computer to convert GeoJSON files to TopoJSON.

**Deployment is only possible if you have Amazon s3 keys provided to you by the Project Linework maintainers.**
